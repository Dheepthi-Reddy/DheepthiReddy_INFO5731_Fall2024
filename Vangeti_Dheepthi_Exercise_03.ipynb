I genuinely got bored and if Ryan Reynolds wasn't there to make it actually funny I probably would've walked out. The fact I'm giving them 2 starts on top of the 4 just because it was funny is crazy.I don't know when Marvel will learn that this multi-verse is ruining them. They're out of ideas and just throwing it into films (as suggested by Ryan in the movie).Saddest part was the fact it was actually really funny. I would say it was probably funnier than the original Deadpool. The potential this franchise has and the past 2 have been complete let downs.Also, if anyone even paid attention to the original Deadpool, surely you know he became the killer he is to avenge his girlfriend's death... and they just completely undid all of that. Disney is like the franchise just buying companies and just eating away at them until there is nothing left. If they can ruin a Deadpool film like this god help them.\",\n          \"After rewatching Deadpool and Wolverine I have struggled to think how to rate the movie given that how there is very evident flaws whilst also being one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.Deadpool and Wolverine is a film that took me a while for it to sync into my mind as being a reality. When the opening marvel sequence was playing out and I heard Deadpool humming the end of the opening theme I instantly said to myself \\\"wow!! This is actually real, we are getting Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU\\\".The opening sequence with the TVA agents being slaughtered by Deadpool using the corpse of Wolverine whilst NSYNC was playing was an absolute blast and felt consistent in the tone with the two previous deadpool films.It was a huge relief to me when watching the movie how they managed to incorporate Wolverine in the movie without disrespecting Logan (2017). Speaking about Wolverine, the interactions between him and Deadpool felt so satisfying with the hilarious dialogue and surprising emotional moments. The couple of fight scenes we get between them were an absolute blast and it was so fulfilling actually getting what we have been waiting for, for soooo long.A lot of people were anticipating the cameos and characters that would turn up in the movie and I for one was pretty happy with what we got. Elektra was a character I had a suspicion about being in the movie and it was nice seeing her, albeit I maybe wanted a bit more from her. Blade was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Channing Tatum's Gambit was a hilarious inclusion and of course Laura turning up brought a lot of heart to the story, though I wish it wasn't spoiled in the trailers. The last big cameo I wanted to mention was the Chris Evans' Human Torch one, I liked how they introduced the character and his death made Cassandra Nova feel really threatening. I did like the antagonists we got in the movie, Mr Paradox was quite funny and Cassandra Nova was really threatening. However, I don't want to sound greedy but I would have maybe liked one or two more short cameos from heroes/villains who were actually in the MCU.This all being said, issues start to arise when you actually take the story apart and look into it. The story is really forgettable as a whole and is doesn't have the urgency to it that it should have had. Also as epic as the final act battle was, there wasn't really any development behind it and is just there to give Deadpool and Wolverine one final fight.The closing credits of the film were really nice and nostalgic! Hearing Green Day's time of your life whilst showing behind the scenes footage of the fox/marvel films was a really heartfelt goodbye to the Fox universe. Instead of insulting them, it was a celebration of them and felt like a fitting goodbye.Anyways, as much as Deadpool and Wolverine is a messy movie with a flawed story, its just too fun to really care to much about that. The fact that this exists is just so cool for comic book fans and I had an absolute blast watching the midnight premiere and even my rewatch of it.Oh I forgot to mention how this had an absolute GOATED soundtrack, Green Day, Avril Lavigne and a song from the movie Grease (1978)...WOW!!!!\",\n          \"Hugh Jackman is the perfect Wolverine. What a fun movie. I like the dialogue and clever quips with f bombs sprinkled in. It's definitely not taking itself too seriously. There is tons of fun cameos I didn't expect! I normally watch spoiler videos ahead of time, but I didn't on this occasion and I'm glad I didn't because there was some oh snap moments! It's a very good action packed fun film. The breaking the Fox jokes and speaking to the camera jokes are too funny. I can definitely see more sequels for these two on the horizon. They are promoting this movie hard I just watched these two on Hot Ones eating chicken wings They make a dynamic duo. Until your 90 Wolverine ...until your 90 lol.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
