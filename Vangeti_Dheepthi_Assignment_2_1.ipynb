I think it's a combination of the two. I thought the first Guardians film was pretty good but did not like the second one that much. Too much heavy-handedness in the themes, too much humor that didn't really land, too many attempts at emotional resonance that fell flat. This is closer to the second than the first in pretty much all of those categories.The best part of the film is probably Iwuji who plays a good villain. Some of the Rocket backstory is good too, if kind of heart-breaking. But most of the film suffers from having such a large number of characters that we're supposed to care about, all breaking off into small groups, spawning subplots that feel too formulaic in their own way. It all builds really obviously into a \\\"send-off\\\" that to me felt kind of forced.There were some entertaining scenes and, again, the parts involving Rocket's backstory were good, albeit a little hard to watch. But I don't really know why everyone seems to be raving about this one so much. To me it was barely better than the second film and definitely not in the upper tier of Marvel films overall.\",\n          \"By far the darker of the GOTG trilogy, but this film still contained a lot of the signature laughs whilst dealing with Rocket's harrowing creation. Thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to finish. James Gunn has created a trilogy I would happily watch over and over. This came at a time where I was feeling the MCU had started to lose its way and a degree of its magic and it was a very welcome surprise bringing back all the appeal from the previous 2 films and Guardians appearances in Avenger films.I particularly enjoyed the hallway fight scene and the way we complete our journey with them by finally understanding Groot.\",\n          \"I can't describe the emotions I felt after watching this movie. It hurt me and so many times I felt like hugging Rocket and telling him how much he means to us. What have you done James Gunn? I can't be same again. I never thought I would cry again after Endgame but then this came. Beautiful ending to an amazing series. But I wish to see more and thank you James for giving my favourite MCU character a main lead.I also wish James Gunn to continue this series with new characters and ofcourse with the old ones. We need more. Amazing voice acting by Bradley Cooper. No wonder he was chosen to voice Rocket.

I think it's a combination of the two. I thought the first Guardians film was pretty good but did not like the second one that much. Too much heavy-handedness in the themes, too much humor that didn't really land, too many attempts at emotional resonance that fell flat. This is closer to the second than the first in pretty much all of those categories.The best part of the film is probably Iwuji who plays a good villain. Some of the Rocket backstory is good too, if kind of heart-breaking. But most of the film suffers from having such a large number of characters that we're supposed to care about, all breaking off into small groups, spawning subplots that feel too formulaic in their own way. It all builds really obviously into a \\\"send-off\\\" that to me felt kind of forced.There were some entertaining scenes and, again, the parts involving Rocket's backstory were good, albeit a little hard to watch. But I don't really know why everyone seems to be raving about this one so much. To me it was barely better than the second film and definitely not in the upper tier of Marvel films overall.\",\n          \"By far the darker of the GOTG trilogy, but this film still contained a lot of the signature laughs whilst dealing with Rocket's harrowing creation.

This came at a time where I was feeling the MCU had started to lose its way and a degree of its magic and it was a very welcome surprise bringing back all the appeal from the previous 2 films and Guardians appearances in Avenger films.I particularly enjoyed the hallway fight scene and the way we complete our journey with them by finally understanding Groot.\",\n          \"I can't describe the emotions I felt after watching this movie. It hurt me and so many times I felt like hugging Rocket and telling him how much he means to us. What have you done James Gunn? I can't be same again. I never thought I would cry again after Endgame but then this came. Beautiful ending to an amazing series. But I wish to see more and thank you James for giving my favourite MCU character a main lead.I also wish James Gunn to continue this series with new characters and ofcourse with the old ones.

I think it's a combination of the two. I thought the first Guardians film was pretty good but did not like the second one that much. Too much heavy-handedness in the themes, too much humor that didn't really land, too many attempts at emotional resonance that fell flat. This is closer to the second than the first in pretty much all of those categories.The best part of the film is probably Iwuji who plays a good villain. Some of the Rocket backstory is good too, if kind of heart-breaking. But most of the film suffers from having such a large number of characters that we're supposed to care about, all breaking off into small groups, spawning subplots that feel too formulaic in their own way. It all builds really obviously into a \\\"send-off\\\" that to me felt kind of forced.There were some entertaining scenes and, again, the parts involving Rocket's backstory were good, albeit a little hard to watch. But I don't really know why everyone seems to be raving about this one so much. To me it was barely better than the second film and definitely not in the upper tier of Marvel films overall.\",\n          \"By far the darker of the GOTG trilogy, but this film still contained a lot of the signature laughs whilst dealing with Rocket's harrowing creation. Thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to finish. James Gunn has created a trilogy I would happily watch over and over. This came at a time where I was feeling the MCU had started to lose its way and a degree of its magic and it was a very welcome surprise bringing back all the appeal from the previous 2 films and Guardians appearances in Avenger films.I particularly enjoyed the hallway fight scene and the way we complete our journey with them by finally understanding Groot.\",\n          \"I can't describe the emotions I felt after watching this movie. It hurt me and so many times I felt like hugging Rocket and telling him how much he means to us. What have you done James Gunn? I can't be same again. I never thought I would cry again after Endgame but then this came. Beautiful ending to an amazing series. But I wish to see more and thank you James for giving my favourite MCU character a main lead.I also wish James Gunn to continue this series with new characters and ofcourse with the old ones. We need more. Amazing voice acting by Bradley Cooper. No wonder he was chosen to voice Rocket.

I think it's a combination of the two. I thought the first Guardians film was pretty good but did not like the second one that much. Too much heavy-handedness in the themes, too much humor that didn't really land, too many attempts at emotional resonance that fell flat. This is closer to the second than the first in pretty much all of those categories.The best part of the film is probably Iwuji who plays a good villain. Some of the Rocket backstory is good too, if kind of heart-breaking. But most of the film suffers from having such a large number of characters that we're supposed to care about, all breaking off into small groups, spawning subplots that feel too formulaic in their own way. It all builds really obviously into a \\\"send-off\\\" that to me felt kind of forced.There were some entertaining scenes and, again, the parts involving Rocket's backstory were good, albeit a little hard to watch. But I don't really know why everyone seems to be raving about this one so much. To me it was barely better than the second film and definitely not in the upper tier of Marvel films overall.\",\n          \"By far the darker of the GOTG trilogy, but this film still contained a lot of the signature laughs whilst dealing with Rocket's harrowing creation. Thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to finish. James Gunn has created a trilogy I would happily watch over and over. This came at a time where I was feeling the MCU had started to lose its way and a degree of its magic and it was a very welcome surprise bringing back all the appeal from the previous 2 films and Guardians appearances in Avenger films.I particularly enjoyed the hallway fight scene and the way we complete our journey with them by finally understanding Groot.\",\n          \"I can't describe the emotions I felt after watching this movie. It hurt me and so many times I felt like hugging Rocket and telling him how much he means to us. What have you done James Gunn? I can't be same again. I never thought I would cry again after Endgame but then this came. Beautiful ending to an amazing series. But I wish to see more and thank you James for giving my favourite MCU character a main lead.I also wish James Gunn to continue this series with new characters and ofcourse with the old ones. We need more. Amazing voice acting by Bradley Cooper. No wonder he was chosen to voice Rocket.

I think it's a combination of the two. I thought the first Guardians film was pretty good but did not like the second one that much. Too much heavy-handedness in the themes, too much humor that didn't really land, too many attempts at emotional resonance that fell flat. This is closer to the second than the first in pretty much all of those categories.The best part of the film is probably Iwuji who plays a good villain. Some of the Rocket backstory is good too, if kind of heart-breaking. But most of the film suffers from having such a large number of characters that we're supposed to care about, all breaking off into small groups, spawning subplots that feel too formulaic in their own way. It all builds really obviously into a \\\"send-off\\\" that to me felt kind of forced.There were some entertaining scenes and, again, the parts involving Rocket's backstory were good, albeit a little hard to watch. But I don't really know why everyone seems to be raving about this one so much. To me it was barely better than the second film and definitely not in the upper tier of Marvel films overall.\",\n          \"By far the darker of the GOTG trilogy, but this film still contained a lot of the signature laughs whilst dealing with Rocket's harrowing creation. Thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to finish. James Gunn has created a trilogy I would happily watch over and over. This came at a time where I was feeling the MCU had started to lose its way and a degree of its magic and it was a very welcome surprise bringing back all the appeal from the previous 2 films and Guardians appearances in Avenger films.I particularly enjoyed the hallway fight scene and the way we complete our journey with them by finally understanding Groot.\",\n          \"I can't describe the emotions I felt after watching this movie. It hurt me and so many times I felt like hugging Rocket and telling him how much he means to us. What have you done James Gunn? I can't be same again. I never thought I would cry again after Endgame but then this came. Beautiful ending to an amazing series. But I wish to see more and thank you James for giving my favourite MCU character a main lead.I also wish James Gunn to continue this series with new characters and ofcourse with the old ones. We need more. Amazing voice acting by Bradley Cooper. No wonder he was chosen to voice Rocket. He is superb.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Clean_Review\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"point cant tell im tire film formula theyr qualiti slump think combin two thought first guardian film pretti good like second one much much heavyhanded theme much humor didnt realli land mani attempt emot reson fell flat closer second first pretti much categoriesth best part film probabl iwuji play good villain rocket backstori good kind heartbreak film suffer larg number charact suppos care break small group spawn subplot feel formula way build realli obvious sendoff felt kind forcedther entertain scene part involv rocket backstori good albeit littl hard watch dont realli know everyon seem rave one much bare better second film definit upper tier marvel film overal\",\n          \"far darker gotg trilog film still contain lot signatur laugh whilst deal rocket harrow creation thoroughli enjoy film start finish jame gunn creat trilog would happili watch came time feel mcu start lose way degre magic welcom surpris bring back appeal previou film guardian appear aveng filmsi particularli enjoy hallway fight scene way complet journey final understand groot\",\n          \"cant describ emot felt watch movi hurt mani time felt like hug rocket tell much mean us done jame gunn cant never thought would cri endgam came beauti end amaz seri wish see thank jame give favourit mcu charact main leadi also wish jame gunn continu seri new charact ofcours old one need amaz voic act bradley cooper wonder chosen voic rocket superb\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I think it's a combination of the two. I thought the first Guardians film was pretty good but did not like the second one that much. Too much heavy-handedness in the themes, too much humor that didn't really land, too many attempts at emotional resonance that fell flat. This is closer to the second than the first in pretty much all of those categories.The best part of the film is probably Iwuji who plays a good villain. Some of the Rocket backstory is good too, if kind of heart-breaking. But most of the film suffers from having such a large number of characters that we're supposed to care about, all breaking off into small groups, spawning subplots that feel too formulaic in their own way. It all builds really obviously into a \\\"send-off\\\" that to me felt kind of forced.There were some entertaining scenes and, again, the parts involving Rocket's backstory were good, albeit a little hard to watch. But I don't really know why everyone seems to be raving about this one so much. To me it was barely better than the second film and definitely not in the upper tier of Marvel films overall.\",\n          \"By far the darker of the GOTG trilogy, but this film still contained a lot of the signature laughs whilst dealing with Rocket's harrowing creation. Thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to finish. James Gunn has created a trilogy I would happily watch over and over. This came at a time where I was feeling the MCU had started to lose its way and a degree of its magic and it was a very welcome surprise bringing back all the appeal from the previous 2 films and Guardians appearances in Avenger films.I particularly enjoyed the hallway fight scene and the way we complete our journey with them by finally understanding Groot.\",\n          \"I can't describe the emotions I felt after watching this movie. It hurt me and so many times I felt like hugging Rocket and telling him how much he means to us. What have you done James Gunn? I can't be same again. I never thought I would cry again after Endgame but then this came. Beautiful ending to an amazing series. But I wish to see more and thank you James for giving my favourite MCU character a main lead.I also wish James Gunn to continue this series with new characters and ofcourse with the old ones. We need more. Amazing voice acting by Bradley Cooper. No wonder he was chosen to voice Rocket.
